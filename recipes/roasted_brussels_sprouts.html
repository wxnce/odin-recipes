    <h2>Description</h2>
    This recipe is from my mother. It may sound strange, but these are really good and very easy to make. The Brussels sprouts should be brown with a bit of black on the outside when done. Any leftovers can be reheated or even just eaten cold from the fridge. I don't know how, but they taste sweet and salty at the same time!    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Brussels Sprouts</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Pepper</li>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 400 deg</li>
        <li>Place trimmed Brussels sprouts, olive oil, kosher salt, and pepper in a large resealable plastic bag. Seal tightly, and shake to coat. Pour onto a baking sheet, and place on center oven rack.</li>
        <li>Roast in the preheated oven for 30 to 45 minutes, shaking pan every 5 to 7 minutes for even browning. Reduce heat when necessary to prevent burning. Brussels sprouts should be darkest brown, almost black, when done. Adjust seasoning with kosher salt, if necessary. Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
